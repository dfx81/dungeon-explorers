# dungeon-explorers
A simple Terminal-styled game in Java using Swing.
Created for Programming 1 group project in UUM.

Post-Mortem:
- Code can be refactored (ex. Render method and Randomizer method)
- Proper AI can be implemented (A*)
- Dungeon generator can be rewritten to use recursion
(find source of stack overflow first!!)
